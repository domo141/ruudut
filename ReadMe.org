Ruudut (pronounced /root/ and /do/ combined as /roo-do-t/); a collection
of software to build up parts of a (minimal) wayland desktop environment.

+ [[font/ReadMe.org][font]] :: emboldened (and narrowed) /Hack/ font

+ [[kbd/ReadMe.org][kbd]] :: keymap /fi-ohjelmoija/ for easier programmer keys

+ [[tools]] :: various tools, for development and after-deployment use

Wa- prefix is to separate Wayland Applications in their own listing block:

+ [[wa-ootappa]] :: red countdown timer in the middle of the screen

+ [[wa-tiili]] :: workspace, day and time, battery status - overlay "brick"

With- prefix is to separate content used with existing desktop components:

+ [[with-labwc]] :: hacky patches and tunes to make labwc work better for my use

+ [[with-urxvt]] :: some urxvt specific tools

+ [[with-xxdiff/qt3]] :: patches to make xxdiff (qt3 version) suit better for my use

Continuing (in ascii order) with non-grouped items:

+ [[wp]] :: the .xml files of wayland protocols used (now and in the past)

# sometimes it is "easier" to edit in (fundamental-mode)
# then, when one knows, or just looks around in (org-mode)
